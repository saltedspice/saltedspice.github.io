## Welcome to Aivan's Life Story

Owned by Aivan Matthew C. Arevalo .

This website is basically a place where I can share my life's story and how things were and how things are until now.

### The Story of My Life

I was born on August 1, 2006. It was a rainy midnight in Naga City when my mother, Aileen C. Arevalo, gave birth to me while my father, Mervyn B. Arevalo was by her side. So everytime that my birthday comes it would always rain. I even remember asking my mother why it always rained when my birthday comes, and that's when she told me that I was born while it was raining, until now not a single birthday has passed where it hasn't rained. Anyway I have an older sister, Bien Gabrielle C. Arevalo. She is three years older than me yet we were both born on August 1. It's kind of ironic that we're not twins, maybe if we were twins we wouldn't tease eachother this much. We're a small family but a happy one. I live in the province of Camarines Sur, Iriga City. When I was a baby, we were just living in a small house made of wood or often refered in the Philippines as "kubo". We didn't have much but atleast we never got hungry and we were happy living simply. When my dad finally got a decent job, that's when we got the opportunity to live in a more comfortable house and we didn't have to worry about being broke. Also a few hobbies of mine are playing basketball, listening to music, drawing and other simple things because simple things make me happy. I love to eat anything that is not sweet, seafood, or celery. I studied in University of Saint Anthony here in Camarines Sur, Iriga City. I made lots of friends there that are still with me until now. When I was in 6th grade, I told my parents that I wanted to study in a different school when i graduate in elementary. After a few days of reflection I made the decision of going to Ateneo De Naga University in Naga City. Sure enough, after a few months I was already enrolled and excited for this new journey. My first year there was amazing and then when you thought things were just going to get better the pandemic started. 2 years later my highschool life is almost at its end and I just wished that I can go back in time and enjoy my first year as if it were my last. But I guess it is what it is. I'm still here and my life has just begun, there is more to this world and as I discover and mature the story of my life will only get longer until one day my story will be told by someone else to the next generation.
